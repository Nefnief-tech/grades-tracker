# Sound Files for Study Timer

This directory contains sound files used by the Study Timer feature:

- `bell.mp3` - Notification sound for when a timer completes
- `tick.mp3` - Subtle tick sound for when the timer starts

If the sound files are missing, the application will fall back to generating sounds using the Web Audio API.
