# ðŸš€ Manual Asset Creation & Quick Start

Since npm scripts aren't updating, let's create the assets manually and get your app running.

## Step 1: Create Assets Manually

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
cd mobile-app
node cleanup-assets.js
node create-assets.js
```

## Step 2: Start Your App

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 3: Test with Expo Go

1. Install **Expo Go** from Google Play Store
2. Scan the QR code that appears
3. Your vocabulary extractor loads instantly! ðŸ“±

## If the individual scripts don't work, create assets manually:

Create the `assets` folder and PNG files:

```bash
mkdir assets
```

Then we'll use an alternative method to create the required PNG files.

## Alternative: Skip Asset Issues Entirely

The app might work without custom assets using Expo's defaults. Try:

```bash
npm start
```

If you get asset errors in Expo Go, we can fix them after the app is running.

## What to expect:

âœ… Camera integration for vocabulary capture  
âœ… AI-powered extraction (with API key)  
âœ… Demo mode (works without API key)  
âœ… Deck management and study mode  
âœ… Offline storage  

Your vocabulary extractor should work perfectly in Expo Go! ðŸŽ‰
