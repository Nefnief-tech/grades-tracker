# Deployment Configuration
# 
# This file instructs deployment platforms to use the prebuilt static files
# instead of running the build process during deployment.
#
# For most static hosting platforms:
# 1. Build locally: npm run build
# 2. Deploy the 'out' directory contents
# 3. Configure your platform to serve from the uploaded files

# Build output directory
BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR=out

# Skip build during deployment
SKIP_BUILD=true

# Static export mode
NEXT_EXPORT=true
