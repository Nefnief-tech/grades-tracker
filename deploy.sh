# Example deployment commands for different platforms:

# For rsync to a server:
# rsync -avz --delete out/ user@server:/path/to/webroot/

# For AWS S3:
# aws s3 sync out/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete

# For FTP:
# lftp -c "open ftp://user:pass@server; mirror -R out/ /path/to/webroot/ --delete"

# For now, just show what would be deployed
